_Some encryption algorythms_

## Synchronous Encryption Algorythms
_Algorythms with a single key_

- [CaesarCipher.java] - **INSECURE!!!**

## Asynchronous Encryption Algorythms
_Algorythms with a public and a private key_

- [AES.java]

## Hashing Algorythms

- HashedPassword.java] (using SHA-256 and a salt by default, which is a very slow hashing algorythm) - **for Passwords**
- ~~[HashedData.java]~~ () - **for Anything except passwords**
